This work focuses on predicting model performance on a target domain **without access to the source data**.

## üìã Method Overview  

The method predicts classifier accuracy on the target domain through the following steps:  
1. **Calculate GMM Statistics**:  
   Compute the mean and covariance of the logits for each class based on the target predictions.  
2. **Calibration**:  
   Replace Softmax with a GMM-based generative model to calibrate the final probabilities of the test sample.
3. **Assess the Correctness of the Prediction**:  
   Calculate 2 losses: CELoss to one-hot encoding for the most probable class, and CELoss to a uniform distribution (random prediction).
   Backpropogate through only the last layer (aka classifier) and compare gradient norms to determine correctness of prediction:  
   - If the gradient norm to the predicted class <= gradient norm to a random class ‚Üí **Correct**.  
   - Otherwise ‚Üí **Incorrect**.

## üîß Installation

Before running the code, install the required dependencies using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Reproducing Results  



### Step 1: Download Pretrained Model  
- Download the MNIST-trained model [lenet_mnist.pt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MN60HAsEjw4EU_NWhDi1x_nJxOVRS4lo/) and place it in the `logs/` folder.  

### Step 2: Run the Experiment  
Run the following command to reproduce results on the **SVHN** and **USPS** datasets:  
``` 
python main.py
```

This code will:
- Automatically download the SVHN and USPS datasets and save them in the `logs/` folder.
- Store the features of the target datasets in the `logs/` folder.
- Predict the model‚Äôs performance on each target dataset.

### Additional Experiments
Explore the `all_experiments/` folder for other experiments and baseline comparisons.
